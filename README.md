### Problem Statement
Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans.
They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend
one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.

You have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the
new plans. For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan.

Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. The threshold for
accuracy is 0.75.
